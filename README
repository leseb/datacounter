1) Introduction

datacounter.sh
 - displays a progress bar on stderr of data activity during 
 read/write operations, mostly in pipes

Inspired by Theiling's 'bar'-'cat' (http://www.theiling.de), but 
uses only one dd, that is triggered by consequent SIGUSR1 signals
from an AWK script that intercepts dd's stderr output.

Initially Tested under:
 - Gentoo Linux 2.6.32-hardened-r9 i686
 - Bash 4.1.7(2)-release (i686-pc-linux-gnu)
 - dd (coreutils) 8.5
 - GNU Awk 3.1.6

2) Usage:
 datacounter.sh <options>
   Options are:
    [-i|--input]  <file>  Input is read from filename
    [-o|--output] <file>  Output is written to filename
    [-t|--time]   <n>     Refresh status every second
    [-q|--quiet]          Do not display anything, be silent
    [-c|--cleanup]        Remove status after a successfull finish
    [-s|--size]           Use provided size in bytes to calculate %

 -> Time can be any value, that is accepted by 'sleep'
 -> Size can be only positive and integer
 -> Data is not corrupted by specifying smaller/bigger values, than
    the amount of data that comes from the input.
 -> If no input/output file option is specified, stdin/out is used.
 -> If input file is specified, stdin is discarded.
 -> Options overwrite the previous values
